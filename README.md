# Sign Language Interpreter using CNN & TensorFlow Lite

A deep learning-based Sign Language Interpreter that recognizes hand gestures representing the English alphabet (Aâ€“Z). This project combines **CNN**, **transfer learning**, and **TensorFlow Lite** for accurate and lightweight sign recognition â€” ready for real-time deployment.

## Objectives

- Build a CNN model to recognize static ASL signs (Aâ€“Z)
- Preprocess image data for training (resize, grayscale, normalization)
- Optimize model for mobile using TensorFlow Lite quantization
- Prepare the model for deployment on real-time platforms

---

## Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `TensorFlow & Keras`
- `OpenCV`
- `NumPy / Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `TensorFlow Lite`

## Dataset

- Dataset: American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Dataset
- Total Classes: **26 (Aâ€“Z)**
- Input Image Size: **64x64 grayscale**
- Preprocessing: Normalization, Resizing, Data Augmentation

---

## Model Architecture

A custom CNN with the following:
- 3 Convolutional layers + MaxPooling
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense layers with `softmax` activation
- Final model exported as `.tflite` with quantization

ðŸ“ˆ **Accuracy Achieved**: ~96%

## Model Optimization (TFLite)

Model converted for mobile deployment:
```python
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
tflite_model = converter.convert()
